In this project I have to analyse Netflix movies & TV shows churn using various tools of Tableau



During the analysis, I created multiple charts, map & column fields using formulas.



Using 7 visualization tabs and combining them, a fully functional dashboard has been created.



Various types of charts like Pie and Bar have been developed during this process.



Thank you
